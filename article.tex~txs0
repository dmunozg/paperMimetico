\begin{abstract}
  The cellular membrane in a highly complex structure with variable and
  inhomogeneous composition which makes the direct study of the sole lipid
  bilayer a very difficult task, this introduces the necessity of membrane
  mimetics, that is, lipid bilayer structures that behave as close as possible
  to the cellular membrane. In this article we present a membrane mimetic with a
  high phospholipid content, the main component in natural lipid membranes, and
  the capability of orienting itself when exposed to an external magnetic field,
  this enables it for studies of its dynamics and mobility employing $^2$H-NMR.
  We validate its permeability properties as membrane mimetic by reproducing the
  membrane-permeating ability of Benzocaine, and the inability of Levodopa to do
  so. We also present a molecular dynamics simulation model of the membrane
  mimetic, calibrated to reproduce experimental $^2$H-NMR results.

\section{Introduction}
The cell is a highly complex unit present in all living organisms: it
constitutes the building block of life. Essentially, consists in a closed domain
containing smaller organelles in a highly complex and crowded aqueous solution,
all enclosed by a bilayer made of mainly pospholipids and containing fatty
acids, sugars, cholesterol and proteins, among others. This bilayer is called
cell membrane or cytoplasmic membrane. Membranes itself are very complex
molecular organizations with variable and inhomogeneous composition, and its
atomic level understanding is a very difficult task. For this reason, the
employment of
membrane mimetics and models has become common practice.\cite{Bondar2019}\\
Because of their ability to orient spontaneously when exposed to an external
magnetic field, bilayered micelles, also called ``bicelles'', have been widely
used as membrane mimetics, as they allow the use of solution NMR to probe the
orientation and dynamics of liposomes\cite{Beaugrand2016}. The bicelle structure
was first introduced in the late 70s as a mixture of sodium decyl sulphate and
1-decanol\cite{Amaral1979}. Later, in the 1990s, it was discovered that a
mixture of DMPC\footnote{1,2-dimyristoyl-\textit{sn}-glycero-3-phosphocholine}
and
CHAPSO\footnote{3-(cholamidopropyl)dymethylammonio-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonate}
forms magnetically orientable bilayered micelles\cite{Sanders1990}, this
composition is suitable to use as a membrane mimetic, as it contains
phospholipid in its composition. Many improvements have been made to this
composition over the years, among these improvements, it was found that
replacing part of the DMPC by
DHPC\footnote{1,2-dihexanoyl-\textit{sn}-glycero-3-phosphocholine} yields a
bilayer structure more similar to a natural lipidic bilayer, it was also found
that the addition of cholesterol improves the stability\cite{Shapiro2010} and
the addition of Triton X-100 detergent improves its magnetic orienting
capabilities\cite{Park2010}. Nowadays, bicelles are considered good membrane
mimetics, as they have been successfully employed to predict drug permeability
through the membrane, and to propose
structures for proteins in the trans-membrane domain. And are ideal for when the
drug-detergent (or protein-detergent) complex is small (<\SI{100}{kDa}), as
these system can be studied in solution NMR\cite{Warschawski2011,Raschle2010,Sanders2006}\\

Membrane proteins play a significant role in human
pathologies\cite{Birnbaumer1999,Gillet2010}. About 30\% of human genes code for
membrane proteins\cite{Fagerberg2010} and they are targeted by more than 50\% of
drugs\cite{Warr1986,Wallin2008}. Therefore, most drugs have to cross membrane
interfaces to reach their active site, and consequently, the activity of these
drugs depends, among other factors, on their ability to perform this task.
% This is particularly true for local anesthetics (LA). For more than hundred
% years it has been observed that the effectiveness of many LA correlates
% positively with
% lipophilicity\cite{Meyer1899,Overton1901,Langerman1994a,Langerman1994}, showing
% the importance of becoming incorporated into the bilayer. It is widely accepted
% that inhibition of voltage gated \ce{Na+} channels is directly involved in the
% mechanism of LA\cite{Hille1977,Wang1998} and three possible pictures have been
% proposed: (a) LA directly binds the pore of the channel blocking the transit of
% ions, (b) LA reaches the active site by one of the lateral cavities filled with
% hydrophobic membrane components, and (c) the presence of LA near the interface
% modifies the structure and dynamics of the bilayer itself, perturbing the
% conformational dynamics and functioning of the
% channel\cite{Oakes2019,Martin2014,Shibata2005,Griepernau2007,EmmaTerama2008,DePaula2008,Cantor1998,Bernardi2009,Godwin2005}.
% Despite which mechanisms are actually taking place, crossing membrane interfaces
% to become incorporated into the hydrophobic domain appears to be a crucial step
% for
% most drugs.\\
Benzocaine is a well known local anesthetic for topical use. It has been widely
employed anesthetizing the oropharynx for trans-esophageal echocardiography,
bonchoscopy, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, in cold sores, mouth ulcers, toothache,
sore gums and denture ache among others\cite{McEvoy2007}.
% A significant number of
% cases of Benzocaine induced cyanosis (methemoglobinemia) have been reported
% along the
% years\cite{Lardieri2019}, however it still remains in use.\\
Benzocaine has been subject of a significant number of studies, including free
energy transfer from water to the interior of different membrane
mimetics\cite{Martin2014a,Cascales2011,Porasso2009,J.J.LopezCascales2006},
estimations about location and orientation in different bilayers and
monolayers\cite{Matsuki2001,Suwalsky2004,Kuroda2000,Choi2001}, interactions with
a variety of
solvents\cite{Cardenas2016,Cardenas2018,Paluch2015,Avila2002,Aguado2013} and
encapsulation in different structures for controlled delivery
purposes\cite{Shkurenko2018,AttouiYahia2017,Li2016,Arantes2014,Puglia2011} among
others. All the evidence confirms that Benzocaine is able to cross the interface
of membrane mimetics to become incorporated into the
hydrophobic bilayer to finally be located at the inner interface.\\

Contrary to most local anesthetics, Levodopa (or L-DOPA), the precursor of the
neurotransmitter dopamine, commonly used in treatment of Parkinson's disease, is
able to cross membrane interfaces only via active processes\cite{Fabbrini1987}.
Therefore, in the absence of appropriate specific receptors, Levodopa should
remain attached to the outer interface and should not reach the hydrophobic
bilayer\cite{Orowski2012}.\\

In this article, we developed a new anionic nematic lyotropic liquid crystal,
with bilayer structure, susceptible to be used as membrane mimetic. It is made
of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 1-decanol (DeOH), sodium sulphate (\ce{Na2SO4})
and a mixture of natural phospholipids extracted from soybean, all dissolved in
water. The anionic mesophase, which spontaneously orients in magnetic fields,
was characterized using polarized light microscopy textures and $^2$H-NMR
quadrupole splittings. To test the capability of the new mimetic to reproduce
cell membrane behavior, Benzocaine and Levodopa were dissolved in the mesophase
solution. According to previous evidence, Benzocaine should spontaneously be
incorporated inside the bilayer and become located around the inner interface,
whereas Levodopa should remain attached to the outer interface. To observe
experimentally the bilayer dynamical behavior and interactions, $^2$H-NMR
quadrupole splittings from HDO, DeOH-$\alpha$-d$_2$ and SDS-d$_{25}$ were
measured. To obtain a more detailed characterization of the bilayer interface
and information about location, dynamics and interactions of Benzocaine and
Levodopa with the bilayer components, the experimental measurements were
complemented with classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The results
show that prevous observations on Benzocaine and Levodopa dissolved in different
membrane mimetics are reproduced in this case, reaffirming the membrane mimetic
character of the new mesophase.

\section{Materials and methods}
\subsection{Materials.}
The reagents SDS, SDS-d$_{25}$, sodium sulphate and a phospholipid mixture
extracted from soybean were purchased from \textit{Sigma Aldrich}. DeOH,
deuterium oxide and HPLC-grade water were purchased from \textit{Merck}. All
these reagents were employed without alterations, excepting sodium sulphate
which was oven dried 24 hours before use. Deuterated 1-decanol
(DeOH-$\alpha$-d$_2$) was synthesized by reducing ethyl decanoate
(\ce{C12H24O2}) with lithium aluminum deuteride (\ce{LiAlD4}) and
purified by vacuum fractional distillation.\\
\subsection{Sample preparation.}
Samples were prepared by mixing each dry component (SDS, \ce{Na2SO4} and
phospholipid mixture) in a \SI{5}{mL} centrifuge tube, and then adding DeOH and
deuterium enriched water(\SI{0.5}{\percent}\ce{D2O}), with each component
weighted and added in proportion according to Bahamondes's
bicelle\cite{Bahamonde-Padilla2013} and phospholipid content was added while
 keeping the rest of the components in
proportion. Each sample is then submitted to a
rotational mixer at \SI{4}{rpm} for 24 hours at a temperature of
\SI{37}{\celsius}, and then centrifuged at \SI{6000}{rpm} for 3 minutes.


\subsection{Nuclear magnetic resonance}
\label{sec:method_nmr}
All solution $^2$H-NMR experiments where carried out on a Bruker Avance 400
spectrometer (Universidad de Santiago de Chile, Santiago, Chile) operating at
\SI{61.422}{MHz}. Spectra were obtained with a $\pi/2$ pulse length of
\SI{22.4}{\micro\second}, an acquisition time of \SI{760}{ms} and a spectral
width of \SI{43.1}{kHz}. 256 scans were acquired per spectrum. Spectra
were acquired at \SI{37}{\celsius}, and a 10 minute pre-acquisition delay was
employed to allow each sample reach thermal equilibrium. Spectra were processed
using Bruker TopSpin 4.0 software.

\subsection{Molecular dynamics}

All simulations were performed using the GROMACS-2016\cite{Abraham2015} software
bundle. A cutoff scheme was used for non-bonding interactions according to each
force-field recommendation values, and long range electrostatic interactions
were calculated employing the particle mesh Ewald method\cite{DiPierro2015}.
Temperature control was achieved with a modified Berendsen
thermostat\cite{Bussi2007} with a time constant of \SI{1.0}{ps}, while pressure
was equilibrated with a semi-isotropic Berendsen barostat\cite{Berendsen1984}
with a time constant of \SI{1.0}{ps} for both xy-plane and z-axis. Both
temperature and pressure were adjusted to \SI{310}{K} and \SI{1}{bar}
respectively. Periodic
boundary conditions were applied on all three dimensions.\\
Before each production simulation, a short equilibration run was performed for a
duration of \SI{1}{ns} with an integration time-step of \SI{1}{fs}. Afterwards,
each production run was calculated to a duration of \SI{40}{ns} with an
integration time-step of \SI{2}{fs}. TIP3P water model was employed on the
simulation with CHARMM36 force-field, while SPC/E was employed on simulations
with Berger and Gromos53A6 force-fields. The same initial configuration was
employed to test each force-field, and it was generated using software
Packmol\cite{Martinez2009} arranging a bilayer with composition in the same
proportion as the membrane mimetic in table \ref{tab:mimetic_composition} to a
total of 9613 molecules. The phospholipid mixture was simulated as a mixture of
39\%
PLPC\footnote{1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl-\textit{sn}-glycero-3-phosphocholine},
26\% DLPC\footnote{1,2-dilinoleoyl-\textit{sn}-glycero-3-phosphocholine}, 24\%
DLPE\footnote{1,2-dilinoleoyl-\textit{sn}-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine} and
11\% DOPE\footnote{1,2-dioleoyl-\text{sn}-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine}. These
proportions were chosen in accordance with the composition of the phospholipid
mixture employed, as
reported by the vendor.\\
PMF calculations were performed employing the Umbrella Sampling/WHAM
method\cite{Kumar1992}. The starting configuration of each simulation window
employed for the PMF calculation was generated from a trajectory of the target
molecule pulling away from the center of the bilayer, making a starting point
each \SI{1.5}{\angstrom}, up to \SI{4.5}{nm} making a total of 30 simulation
windows. Each simulation window was calculated with the same parameters as the
calibrated model shown ahead, up to a total of \SI{20}{ns} on each window, with
a weak harmonic force with constant
\SI{240}{\kilo\joule\per\mole\per\nano\meter\squared} applied on the bilayer
in order to restrain its shape and position.\\

\section{Results and discussion}

\subsection{Preparation of the membrane mimetic}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{splitting_v_phospholipid}
  \caption{Quadrupolar splittings of 1-decanol-$\alpha$-$d_2$ and \ce{D2O} in
    $^2$H-RMN as a function of the phospholipid content in the mimetic.}
  \label{fig:1st_max}
\end{figure}

In order to achieve a membrane mimetic that behaves as similar as possible to
the actual cellular membrane, it is necessary to maximize its phospholipid
concentration. This is important considering that multiple researchers have
concluded that there are specific interactions between the phosphate from the
multiple phospholipids and certain amino-acids that modify the membrane
permeability where this interaction occurs\cite{Aliaga2011,Hristova2011}.\\
Also, the membrane mimetic must orient itself in presence of an external
magnetic field. This is so the deuterated probes in the mimetic can produce a
\textit{quadrupole splitting} in its $^2$H-RMN spectrum, which will be used to
assess the mobility, location and orientation of deuterium labeled components.\\
Both these requirements were fulfilled by employing the membrane mimetic
developed by Bahamondes \textit{et al}\cite{Bahamonde-Padilla2013} as starting
point, then introducing and maximizing the concentration of phospholipid onto
this composition. The maximization was performed in two steps. In a first step,
a batch of membrane mimetics was prepared, each one with an increasing amount of
phospholipid from 0\% up to 30\% (see figure \ref{fig:1st_max}), $^2$H-RMN
spectra and polarized light microscopy pictures were taken to each prepared
membrane mimetic. From these, the composition with 22\% of phospholipid was
chosen to continue with the next maximization step, as this was the composition
with highest phospholipid content that retained a $^2$H-NMR spectrum
characteristic of a nematic phase (see figure \ref{fig:22v23}).\\

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \begin{subfigure}{0.45\columnwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{schlieren_1max}
    \caption{4\% Phospholipid}

  \end{subfigure}
  \begin{subfigure}{0.45\columnwidth}

  \end{subfigure}
  \caption{Polarized light microscopy pictures of membrane mimetics at different
  phospholipid concentration. Both pictures taken at 100x zoom.}
  \label{fig:plm}
\end{figure}

During this step of maximization, we noticed a phase transition upon reaching
around 8\%, this phase transition was also evidenced by polarized light
microscopy (see figure \ref{fig:plm}) where a transition from a
\textit{Schlieren} pattern (fig. \ref{fig:schlieren}) to an \textit{oily streak}
pattern (fig. \ref{fig:oily}) was observed. While both patterns are
characteristic of lyotropic bilayer structured nematic phases, further
experiments are required to assess the exact structure of each phase.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{nematic_v_semisolid}
  \caption{Comparison between $^2$H-NMR spectra from HDO in nematic and
    semi-solid phases}
  \label{fig:22v23}
\end{figure}

The second maximization step was performed by reducing the amount of SDS used to
prepare each mimetic and subsequently adding phospholipid until a nematic phase
was no longer obtained. The results from the membrane mimetic candidates
prepared in this step are summarized in figure \ref{fig:phase_diag}. From these
preparations, again, the composition with the highest phospholipid content that
retained a nematic phase was chosen for further experimentation. The exact
composition of the membrane mimetic is detailed in table \ref{tab:mimetic_composition}

\begin{figure}[h]

  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{phase_diag}
  \caption{Partial phase diagram of the membrane mimetic when varying SDS and
    phospholipid content. The selected composition is marked as a green

\end{figure}

    Water & 49.12\% \\

  \end{tabular*}
\end{table}

\subsection{Calibration of a computational model}
\label{sec:calib}

In order to obtain significant information from a molecular dynamic simulation,
it has to be calibrated to reproduce known experimental results. \par As a first
step, three force-fields with different partial charge distributions were
tested. These force-fields were chosen due to their ability to reproduce
structures of SDS aggregates\cite{Tang2014}.\par
The tested force-fields were:
\begin{itemize}
\item CHARMM36\cite{Vanommeslaeghe2009}
\item Berger\cite{Berger1997} with partial charge distribution according to Merz-Kollman
  method\cite{Besler1990}
\item Berger with partial charge distribution according to Gromos53A6\cite{Oostenbrink2004}
  parameters.
\item Gromos53A6 with partial charge distribution according to Merz-Kollman
  method. And
\item Gromos53A6 with partial charge distribution according to its own parameters.
\end{itemize}

From each resulting simulation run, deuterium order parameters ($S_{CD}$) were
calculated for the SDS aliphatic chain, which were used to calculate a predicted
quadrupolar splitting employing equation (\ref{eq:splitting}) which depends on a
coupling constant ($e^2qQ/h$, \SI{170}{kHz} for aliphatic deuterons\todo{citar
  esto}) and the angle ($\theta$) between the normal to the bilayer and the
applied magnetic field. Software \texttt{gmx order} included in GROMACS was
employed to calculate the deuterium order parameter from each simulation.

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:splitting}
  \Delta\nu = \frac{3}{4} \frac{e^2qQ}{h}(3\cos^2\theta - 1) S_{CD}
\end{equation}

These predicted quadrupolar splittings were compared with experimental results,
as shown in figure \ref{fig:calibration}, concluding that employing the
Gromos53A6 force-field yields the results that are closer to experimental ones
(see figure \ref{fig:reference}), obtaining a good correlation on the carbons
near to the interface and diverging towards the interior of the bilayer.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{nmr_reference}
  \caption{$^2$H-NMR spectrum of membrane mimetic enriched with SDS-d$_{25}$.
    Central peak (not shown completely) belongs to \ce{HDO} present in the
    sample, while the rest of the signals are split SDS-d$_{25}$ signals which
    were used as reference to calibrate a computational model.}
  \label{fig:reference}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{calibration}
  \caption{Quadrupolar splittings of SDS-d$_{25}$ from a $^2$H-NMR. Comparison
    between experimental results and predicted by molecular dynamics employing
    different force-fields}
  \label{fig:calibration}
\end{figure}

Further improvement was done to the fitting of predicted results by employing
two thermostats in the simulation, one governing the bulk solution with a
reference temperature of \SI{310}{K} and another governing the bilayer
components with a reference temperature of \SI{320}{K}. The reasoning behind
this decision was based on the expectation that the increased velocity on the
bilayer components would have a further effect on the mobility towards the
center on the bilayer rather than in the interface, where Coulombic interactions
are stronger and have a restraining effect on the mobility of the bilayer. After
this adjustment, the simulation results in predicted quadrupolar splittings in
very good agreement with the experimental ones, as shown in figure
\ref{fig:2nd_calibration}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{calibration2}
  \caption{Quadrupolar splittings of SDS-d$_{25}$ from a $^2$H-NMR. Comparison
    between experimental results and predicted by molecular dynamics with
    symmetric and asymmetric thermostat}
  \label{fig:2nd_calibration}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Membrane mimetic interface characterization}
\label{sec:characterization}

With the same setting as in the calibrated model, a simulation run to a total of
\SI{100}{ns} was performed, and in order to characterize the bulk-bilayer
interface, charge density profiles were calculated for sodium, sulphate and
dodecyl sulphate ions (see figure \ref{fig:charge_density}).

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{charge_density}
  \caption{Charge densities of the simulated membrane mimetic.}
  \label{fig:charge_density}
\end{figure}

These charge density profiles show the dodecyl sulphate's negative charge
peaking \SI{1.74}{nm} away from the bilayer center, and the counter-ion sodium
peaking \SI{1.0}{\angstrom} away at \SI{1.84}{nm} from the bilayer center. The
high charge polarization ($\sim\pm$\SI{1.5}{q_e \per\nano\cubic\meter}) present in
this area acts as the main barrier against polar compounds, such as
zwitter-ionic Levodopa.\\

A radial distribution function of water and sodium from sulfur in dodecyl
sulfate yields a better picture of the interface structure (see figure
\ref{fig:rdf}). As can be seen from the radial distribution functions, a first
layer of tightly oriented water molecules envelopes the outer layer of the
membrane, with most of the sodium counter-ions locating further away from this
water layer, at \SI{\sim 5}{\angstrom} from the sulfur.
\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{rdf}
  \caption{Radial density function of water and sodium from sulfur in dodecyl sulphate.}
  \label{fig:rdf}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Membrane mimetic validation}
\label{sec:validation}

In order to corroborate that the composition achieved (table
\ref{tab:mimetic_composition}) behaves as a membrane mimetic, we tested the
permeation properties of two drugs: Benzocaine, that is known to be able to passively
cross the cellular membrane; and Levodopa, which is known to be able to cross the
cellular membrane via active mechanisms, therefore it should not be able to
permeate a membrane mimetic without specific receptors.

\subsubsection{Benzocaine control}
\label{sec:benzo}

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{benzo_profile_density}
  \caption{Mean force potential profile for the process of Benzocaine
    translocating through a membrane mimetic. The blue dotted area represents
    the water particle density, while the smooth orange area represents the
    lipid particle density in the simulation.}
  \label{fig:benzocaine_profile}
\end{figure}
Employing the calibrated model stated before, a potential of mean force (PMF)
profile was calculated for the process of Benzocaine permeating the membrane
(figure \ref{fig:benzocaine_profile}). From this PMF profile it can be deduced
that Benzocaine goes through three steps in order to complete its translocation:
First, it integrates spontaneously with the outer leaflet of the bilayer,
without mayor interactions with the Stern layer. Secondly, Benzocaine
``flip-flops'' to the opposite leaflet of the bilayer with a small activation
energy (\SI{11.2}{\kilo\joule}). And third and finally, it escapes the bilayer
into the bulk at a minor energetic cost (\SI{27.1}{kJ}), showing that Benzocaine
permeation through the membrane mimetic is indeed possible.\\
\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{sds_variation}
  \caption{Variation on quadrupolar splittings in $^2$H-NMR upon adding
    Benzocaine or Levodopa to a membrane mimetic sample enriched with
    SDS-d$_{25}$.}
  \label{fig:sds_benzocaine}
\end{figure}
$^2$H-NMR spectrum was taken from a membrane mimetic sample with \SI{8}{mg}
Benzocaine added per gram of mimetic enriched with SDS-d$_{25}$, and compared to
a spectrum of the same mimetic without the anesthetic (figure
\ref{fig:sds_benzocaine}). From this result, it can be seen that the presence of
Benzocaine alters the quadrupolar splittings of the SDS aliphatic chain 
from the first up to the sixth carbon, implying that Benzocaine is mostly
residing in this area, this is concordant with the results of the PMF profile
(figure \ref{fig:benzocaine_profile}), which shows that the most stable position
for the Benzocaine to be in, is indeed inside the bilayer and closer to the
interface.



\subsubsection{Levodopa control}
\label{sec:ldopa}

Employing the same method as in Benzocaine, a PMF profile was calculated for the
process of Levodopa permeating the membrane mimetic (figure
\ref{fig:levodopa_profile}). This profile shows that the position of lowest
energy for Levodopa to be in, is outside the bilayer, alongside the Stern layer;
it also shows that in order to permeate the bilayer, Levodopa requires a rather
large activation energy (\SI{102.4}{\kilo\joule\per\mol}) in order to translocate
through the membrane, showing that a passive permeation of Levodopa through the
membrane mimetic is actually not possible at physiological temperature.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{ldopa_profile_density}    
  \caption{Mean force potential profile for the process of Levodopa
    translocating through a membrane mimetic. The blue dotted area represents
    the water particle density, while the smooth orange area represents the
    lipid particle density in the simulation.}
  \label{fig:levodopa_profile}
\end{figure}

This previous result is supported by $^2$H-NMR spectra. When studying the
effects of adding \SI{7}{mg} of Levodopa per gram of membrane mimetic enriched
with SDS-d$_{25}$ the effects are minor to negligible (see figure \ref{fig:sds_benzocaine}),
implying that the Levodopa molecules are unable to enter the bilayer to alter
its mobility.

\section{Conclusions}
The inclusion of a natural phospholipid mixture in high concentration, make this membrane mimetic a better
model re~producing interactions between proteins (or peptides) and the bilayer,
considering that multiple researchers\cite{Aliaga2011,Hristova2011} have found
that there is an specific interaction between arginine and the phosphate from
each phospholipid
that modify the properties of the membrane where this interaction occurs.\\
Furthermore, the low cost of the components of this membrane mimetic, compared to the classic DMPC/CHAPSO bicelle, makes it feasible to perform permeability studies of many drugs in tandem.\\
Also, the ability to orient itself in an external magnetic field and its sodium
dodecyl sulphate content, which is relatively inexpensive in deuterated form,
makes this membrane mimetic ideal for studies of dynamics employing solution $^2$H-NMR.\\
Furthermore, we present a calibrated simulation model employing molecular
dynamics, which as shown with the PMF profiles of Benzocaine and Levodopa, it
allows to obtain information about the translocating process that is usually
unfeasible to obtain via experimental means.\\
And finally, having proven that Benzocaine, a local anesthetic that permeates
the cellular membrane, is able to translocate through the membrane mimetic
proposed in this article; and that Levodopa, an amino-acid that cannot permeate
passively the cellular membrane, is unable to do so through the membrane
mimetic, we conclude that the membrane mimetic composition we propose has
similar permeation properties as a cellular membrane, and thus, validating the
proposed composition as an actual
membrane mimetic.\\
