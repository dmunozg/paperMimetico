abstract = {In molecular dynamics (MD) simulations the need often arises to maintain such parameters as temperature or pressure rather than energy and volume, or to impose gradients for studying transport properties in nonequilibrium MD. A method is described to realize coupling to an external bath with constant temperature or pressure with adjustable time constants for the coupling. The method is easily extendable to other variables and to gradients, and can be applied also to polyatomic molecules involving internal constraints. The influence of coupling time constants on dynamical variables is evaluated. A leap-frog algorithm is presented for the general case involving constraints with coupling to both a constant temperature and a constant pressure bath.},

abstract = {The Weighted Histogram Analysis Method (WHAM), an extension of Ferrenberg and Swendsen's Multiple Histogram Technique, has been applied for the first time on complex biomolecular Hamiltonians. The method is presented here as an extension of the Umbrella Sampling method for free-energy and Potential of Mean Force calculations. This algorithm possesses the following advantages over methods that are currently employed: (1) It provides a built-in estimate of sampling errors thereby yielding objective estimates of the optimal location and length of additional simulations needed to achieve a desired level of precision; (2) it yields the “best” value of free energies by taking into account all the simulations so as to minimize the statistical errors; (3) in addition to optimizing the links between simulations, it also allows multiple overlaps of probability distributions for obtaining better estimates of the free-energy differences. By recasting the Ferrenberg–Swendsen Multiple Histogram equations in a form suitable for molecular mechanics type Hamiltonians, we have demonstrated the feasibility and robustness of this method by applying it to a test problem of the generation of the Potential of Mean Force profile of the pseudorotation phase angle of the sugar ring in deoxyadenosine. {\textcopyright} 1992 by John Wiley {\&} Sons, Inc.},

In numerical applications this quantity can be used to measure the accuracy of the sampling.

abstract = {X-linked recessive nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the V2 vasopressin receptor (V2R), the mediator of the antidiuretic effect of arginine vasopressin (AVP) in mammalian kidneys. Upon binding to AVP, the receptor activates the G protein G(s), stimulating a phosphorylation cascade that promotes translocation of presynthesized water channels to the apical surface of the principal cells lining the last segments of the nephron. The presence of these channels allows the flow of water from the hypotonic lumen of the nephron into the hypertonic interstitium. More than 100 different mutations have been identified since the receptor gene was characterized - in most cases one per family, although some families bear two and three mutations in the same gene. The frequency of the de novo mutations identified suggests that the DNA at the end of the long arm of the X chromosome is very susceptible to alteration. The mutations are scattered within the coding region, not confined to a particular segment of the receptor protein, and in most cases confined to a single amino acid change that significantly reduces the number of receptors present on the plasma membrane. Some mutations do not affect protein synthesis but significantly reduce the coupling efficiency between the receptor and G protein. Analysis of the biochemical impact of the mutations has provided valuable information about the synthesis and regulation of the receptor. (C) 2000 IMSS.},

Twenty to 30{\%} of all ORFs are predicted to encode membrane proteins, with the larger genomes containing a higher fraction than the smaller ones. Although there is a general tendency that proteins with a smaller number of transmembrane segments are more prevalent than those with many, uni-cellular organisms appear to prefer proteins with 6 and 12 transmembrane segments, whereas Caenorhabditis elegans and Homo sapiens have a slight preference for proteins with seven transmembrane segments. In all organisms, there is a tendency that membrane proteins either have many transmembrane segments with short connecting loops or few transmembrane segments with large extra-membraneous domains. Membrane proteins from all organisms studied, except possibly the archaeon Methanococcus jannaschii, follow the so-called "positive-inside" rule; i.e., they tend to have a higher frequency of positively charged residues in cytoplasmic than in extra-cytoplasmic segments.},

Few three-dimensional structures of membrane proteins have been obtained, which makes computational prediction of membrane proteins crucial for studies of these key molecules. Here, seven membrane protein topology prediction methods based on different underlying algorithms, such as hidden Markov models, neural networks and support vector machines, have been used for analysis of the protein sequences from the 21 416 annotated genes in the human genome. The number of genes coding for a protein with predicted a-helical transmembrane region(s) ranged from 5508 to 7651, depending on the method used. Based on a majority decision method, we estimate 5539 human genes to code for membrane proteins, corresponding to approximately 26{\%} of the human protein-coding genes. The largest fraction of these proteins has only one predicted transmembrane region, but there are also many proteins with seven predicted transmembrane regions, including the G-protein coupled receptors.

In this study, long-time molecular dynamics simulations have been performed to investigate the effect of 1-alkanols of various carbon chain lengths onto the structure and dynamics of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine bilayers. The simulations were complemented by microcalorimetry, continuous bleaching and film balance experiments. In the simulations, all investigated 1-alkanols assembled inside the lipid bilayer within tens of nanoseconds. Their hydroxyl groups bound preferentially to the lipid carbonyl group and the hydrocarbon chains stretched into the hydrophobic core of the bilayer. Both molecular dynamics simulations and experiments showed that all 1-alkanols drastically affected the bilayer properties. Insertion of long-chain 1-alkanols decreased the area per lipid while increasing the thickness of the bilayer and the order of the lipids. The bilayer elasticity was reduced and the diffusive motion of the lipids within the bilayer plane was suppressed. On the other hand, integration of ethanol into the bilayer enlarged the area per lipid. The bilayer became softer and lipid diffusion was enhanced. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The membrane conductances increased in the order of PC ≪ PC/PS ≤ PC/SM ≪ PC/PE. When the constant voltage of -100 or -70 mV was applied through the lipid bilayer membranes in the presence of positively charged tetracaine, the fluctuating current pulses with the large amplitude generated, but not appeared in the absence of tetracaine. The addition of uncharged benzocaine generated the fluctuating currents with the small amplitude. Both charged tetracaine and uncharged benzocaine facilitated electrophoretically the transport of small ions such as KCl in the buffer solution through the fluctuating pores in the lipid bilayer membranes formed by interaction with the local anesthetic under the negative applied membrane potential. The current pulses also contained actual transport of charged tetracaine together with the transport of the small ions. The amplitude and the duration time of the electrical current generated by adding the local anesthetics were dependent on the type of the lipid, the applied voltage and its voltage polarity. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Sodium channel blockers are used to control electrical excitability in cells as a treatment for epileptic seizures and cardiac arrhythmia, and to provide short term control of pain. Development of the next generation of drugs that can selectively target one of the nine types of voltage-gated sodium channel expressed in the body requires a much better understanding of how current channel blockers work. Here we make use of the recently determined crystal structure of the bacterial voltage gated sodium channel NavAb in molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the position at which the sodium channel blocking drugs benzocaine and phenytoin bind to the protein as well as to understand how these drugs find their way into resting channels. We show that both drugs have two likely binding sites in the pore characterised by nonspecific, hydrophobic interactions: one just above the activation gate, and one at the entrance to the the lateral lipid filled fenestrations. Three independent methods find the same sites and all suggest that binding to the activation gate is slightly more favourable than at the fenestration. Both drugs are found to be able to pass through the fenestrations into the lipid with only small energy barriers, suggesting that this can represent the long posited hydrophobic entrance route for neutral drugs. Our simulations highlight the importance of a number of residues in directing drugs into and through the fenestration, and in forming the drug binding sites. {\textcopyright} 2014 Martin, Corry.},

The putative LA receptor has been delineated within the transmembrane segment S6 in domain IV of voltage-gated Na+ channels, whereas the putative BTX receptor iS within segment S6 in domain I. In this study, we created BTX-resistant muscle Na+ channels at segment I-S6 ($\mu$1-N434K, $\mu$1-L437K) to test whether these residues modulate LA binding. These mutant channels were expressed in transiently transfected human embryonic kidney 293T cells, and their sensitivity to lidocaine, QX- 314, etidocaine, and benzocaine was assayed under whole-cell, voltage-clamp conditions. Our results show that LA binding in BTX-resistant $\mu$1 Na+ channels was reduced significantly. At -100 mV holding potential, the reduction in LA affinity was maximal for QX-314 (by 17-fold) and much less for neutral benzocaine (by 2-fold). Furthermore, this reduction was residue specific; substitution of positively charged lysine with negatively charged aspartic acid ($\mu$1-N434D) restored or even enhanced the LA affinity. We conclude that $\mu$1-N434K and $\mu$1-L437K residues located near the middle of the I-S6 segment of Na+ channels can reduce the LA binding affinity without BTX. Thus, this reduction of the LA affinity by point mutations at the BTX binding site is not caused by gating changes induced by BTX alone. We surmise that the BTX receptor and the LA receptor within segments I-S6 and IV-S6, respectively, may align near or within the Na+ permeation pathway.},

Mice (n = 150) were randomly allocated into 15 groups. Intrathecal injections of etidocaine (E), tetracaine (T), bupivacaine (B), lidocaine (L), or procaine (P) were administered and analgetic effect was measured using tail-flick (TF) test.

The EC50 values between E (0.017{\%}), T (0.019{\%}), and B (0.012{\%}) were not significantly variant. The EC50 of L (0.098{\%}) and P (0.229{\%}) were significantly different from each other and from E, T, and B. The EC50 values were converted to ED50 in nmols. Relative anesthetic potency, defined as the inverse value of ED50 of drug was 23:16:15:2.4:1 for B, E, T, L, and P, respectively. ED50 showed high correlation (R = 0.978) with partition coefficients of local anesthetics. This study implies that the partition coefficient is a predictor of intrathecal local anesthetic potency.

We used computational methods to construct a simple model of benzocaine analog binding with the D4S6 segment of rat skeletal muscle (Na V4.1) sodium channels. The model revealed that four hydrophobic residues form a binding cavity for neutral LAs, and docking studies indicated that increasing hydrophobicity among the benzocaine analogs allowed a better fit within the binding cavity. The similarities between our simple model and published experimental data suggested that modeling of LA interactions with sodium channels, along with experimental approaches, could further enhance our understanding of LA interactions with sodium channels. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {It is still controversial how local anesthetics (LAs) act upon the nervous system and how the membrane contributes to this process, since probably the most important active site of the LAs is located in the sodium channels, a trans-membrane protein. An important role of the bio-membrane would be the stabilization and orientation of local anesthetics molecules, reducing their translational and rotational degrees of freedom, which could reinforce the mechanisms which interrupt the nervous impulse. This study aims to perform a computational analysis of the LAs behaviour in the membrane, and the effect of the water/membrane interface on their stabilization and orientation. Analysis by molecular dynamics (MD) showed that the charged form of these drugs are oriented at the interface, while the neutral form can easily cross the interface, entering the membrane, in agreement with the most recent experimental results in the literature. In contrast, it is here suggested that benzocaine (BZC), which exists only in its uncharged form in physiological media, behaves like the charged anesthetics, remaining stabilized and oriented at the interface. This could explain the similar anesthetic effect of BZC and the charged forms of tetracaine (TTC) and lidocaine (LDC).},

abstract = {1. A lipid-mediated mechanism of general anesthesia is suggested and investigated using lattice statistical thermodynamics. 2. Anesthetics are predicted to shift the distribution of lateral pressure within a lipid bilayer, and thus alter the mechanical work required to open ion channel proteins, if channel opening is accompanied by a non-uniform change in cross-sectional area of the protein. 3. Calculations based on this mechanical thermodynamic hypothesis yield qualitative agreement with anesthetic potency at clinical anesthetic membrane concentrations, and predict the alkanol cutoff and anomalously low potencies of strongly hydrophobic molecules with little attraction for the aqueous interface, such as perfluorocarbons.

abstract = {We have examined the effect of the uncharged species of lidocaine (LDC) and etidocaine (EDC) on the acyl chain moiety of egg phosphatidylcholine liposomes. Changes in membrane organization caused by both anesthetics were detected through the use of EPR spin labels (5, 7 and 12 doxyl stearic acid methyl ester) or fluorescence probes (4, 6, 10, 16 pyrene-fatty acids). The disturbance caused by the LA was greater when the probes were inserted in more external positions of the acyl chain and decreased towards the hydrophobic core of the membrane. The results indicate a preferential insertion of LDC at the polar interface of the bilayer and in the first half of the acyl chain, for EDC. Additionally, 2H NMR spectra of multilamellar liposomes composed by acyl chain-perdeutero DMPC and EPC (1:4 mol{\%}) allowed the determination of the segmental order (Smol) and dynamics (T1) of the acyl chain region. In accordance to the fluorescence and EPR results, changes in molecular orientation and dynamics are more prominent if the LA preferential location is more superficial, as for LDC while EDC seems to organize the acyl chain region between carbons 2-8, which is indicative of its positioning. We propose that the preferential location of LDC and EDC inside the bilayers creates a "transient site", which is related to the anesthetic potency since it could modulate the access of these molecules to their binding site(s) in the voltage-gated sodium channel. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We have combined experiments with atomic-scale molecular dynamics simulations to consider the influence of ethanol on a variety of lipid membrane properties. We first employed isothermal titration calorimetry together with the solvent-null method to study the partitioning of ethanol molecules into saturated and unsaturated membrane systems. The results show that ethanol partitioning is considerably more favorable in unsaturated bilayers, which are characterized by their more disordered nature compared to their saturated counterparts. Simulation studies at varying ethanol concentrations propose that the partitioning of ethanol depends on its concentration, implying that the partitioning is a nonideal process. To gain further insight into the permeation of alcohols and their influence on lipid dynamics, we also employed molecular dynamics simulations to quantify kinetic events associated with the permeation of alcohols across a membrane, and to characterize the rotational and lateral diffusion of lipids and alcohols in these systems. The simulation results are in agreement with available experimental data and further show that alcohols have a small but non-vanishing effect on the dynamics of lipids in a membrane. The influence of ethanol on the lateral pressure profile of a lipid bilayer is found to be prominent: ethanol reduces the tension at the membrane - water interface and reduces the peaks in the lateral pressure profile close to the membrane - water interface. The changes in the lateral pressure profile are several hundred atmospheres. This supports the hypothesis that anesthetics may act by changing the lateral pressure profile exerted on proteins embedded in membranes. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Chemical Society.},

The binding constants decrease by ∼100-fold to approximately 300 and 200 M-1 for BZC and PABA, respectively, upon deprotonation of these guest molecules in PBS buffered solution (pH = 7.4). However, the encapsulation of these guest molecules by CB[7] only resulted in very moderate pKa shifts. This supramolecular encapsulation of BZC and PABA could potentially find applications in drug formulation for the purpose of enhancing bio-absorption as well as reducing methemoglobinemia and allergic reactions caused by the derivation of PABA during the metabolism of BZC.},

The lowest conformers have been exposed to fully geometry optimization employing four DFT functionals: B3LYP, CAM-B3LYP, M05-2X and M06-2X. The performed DFT calculations have identified the model B, in which the amino group is located at the primary face of $\beta$-CD, as the most stable complex by an amount up to −40 kcal/mol. Further, the greater stabilization of model B in respect to model A, has been ascertained through AIM and NBO analyses which clarified the main hydrogen bonds HBs interactions governing the reactivity of BZC inside the hydrophobic cavity of $\beta$-CD. Finally, the estimated isotropic 1H nuclear magnetic shielding constants generated from the gauge-including-atomic-orbital calculation have been analyzed and then compared with the available experimental data.},

Based on published thermodynamic quantities of dissolution, partitioning, and sublimation of BZC, the thermodynamic quantities of solvation for this drug in some mutually saturated solvents were calculated. Organic solvents under consideration were cyclohexane (CH), isopropyl myristate (IPM), and 1-octanol (ROH). In all cases, these thermodynamic quantities (i.e. (Formula presented.) , (Formula presented.) , and (Formula presented.)) were negative, indicating that dissolution is the more favourable state for BZC. Thermodynamic quantities of drug dilution in the organic solvents were also calculated. Accordingly, Gibbs energies of dilution were not favourable in all the three organic solvents (i.e. (Formula presented.) {\textgreater} 0). From the obtained values for the different transfer processes, an interpretation based on solute–solute and solute–solvent interactions was developed.},

The 2H NMR spectra of benzocaine-d4, benzocaine-d5, butamben-d4, and butamben-d9 in the model membranes were observed. The 2H NMR spectra of perdeuterated palmitic acid and selectively deuterated palmitic acids at C2, C3, C5, C6, C9, or C10, which were inserted into the lipid membranes, were also observed. The phosphatidyl-serine (PS), phosphatidylcholine (PC), and liquid mixtures composed of PS, PC, and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), which contain or do not contain cholesterol, were employed. A moment analysis was applied to the 2H NMR spectra of palmitic-d31 acid. An order parameter, S(CD), for each carbon segment was calculated from the observed quadruple splitting. We concluded that in the lipid mixture containing cholesterol, the aromatic rings of benzocaine and butamben locate around the glycerol moiety of the lipids and that when there exists no cholesterol, they locate a little more inside from the headgroup region, directing, in both cases, their amino groups upward (polar region) and the ethyl and butyl groups downward (hydrophobic region). These data cast a question on the site of action of the neutral local anesthetics in the sodium channels.},

The latter consisted of isolated unsealed human erythrocyte membranes (IUM), large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) of dimyristoylphospatidylcholine (DMPC), and phospholipid multilayers of DMPC and dimyristoylphospatidyletanolamine (DMPE), representatives of phospholipid classes located in the outer and inner monolayers of the human erythrocyte membrane, respectively. Optical and scanning electron microscopy of human erythrocytes revealed that benzocaine induced the formation of echinocytes. Experiments performed on IUM and DMPC LUV by fluorescence spectroscopy showed that benzocaine interacted with the phospholipid bilayer polar groups and hydrophobic acyl chains. X-ray diffraction analysis of DMPC confirmed these results and showed that benzocaine had no effects on DMPE. The effect on sodium transport was also studied using the isolated toad skin. Electrophysiological measurements indicated a significant decrease in the potential difference (PD) and in the short-circuit current (Isc) after the application of benzocaine, reflecting inhibition of active ion transport. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The partitioning of uncharged local anesthetic benzocaine (BzC) into molecular aggregates formed by cationic surfactant decylammonium chloride (DeAC) and phospholipid dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) was studied from the surface tension and light transmittance measurements. The quantities concerning the partitioning of BzC, the compositions of BzC in the surface-adsorbed film and micelle and three kinds of differential partition coefficients corresponding to phase transitions of the DPPC bilayer membrane were evaluated from thermodynamic analysis of the experimental data. The surface-adsorbed film and micelle were more abundant in BzC than the aqueous solution and significantly large differential partition coefficients for the DPPC membranes were observed. The results clearly showed that the BzC molecules greatly partitioned into hydrophobic environments produced by surfactant-monolayer and phospholipid-bilayer membranes. The partitioning behavior of BzC was also compared with that of charged local anesthetic procaine hydrochloride (PC{\textperiodcentered}HCl). It was shown that the PC{\textperiodcentered}HCl molecule did not or hardly partition into such hydrophobic environments. The contrasting results of the partitioning between BzC and PC{\textperiodcentered}HCl are attributable to the drastic decrease of hydrophilicity of BzC due to the lacking of ionic polar head group in comparison with PC{\textperiodcentered}HCl.

abstract = {The study of asymmetric lipid bilayers is of a crucial importance due to the great number of biological process in which they are involved such as exocytosis, intracellular fusion processes, phospholipid-protein interactions, and signal transduction pathway. In addition, the loss of this asymmetry is a hallmark of the early stages of apoptosis. In this regard, a model of an asymmetric lipid bilayer composed of DPPC and DPPS was simulated by molecular dynamics simulation. Thus, the asymmetric membrane was modeled by 264 lipids, of which 48 corresponded to DPPS- randomly distributed in the same leaflet with 96 DPPC. In the other leaflet, 120 DPPC were placed without DPPS-. Due to the presence of a net charge of -1 for the DPPS - in physiological conditions, 48 Na+ were introduced into the system to balance the charge. To ascertain whether the presence of the DPPS- in only one of the two leaflets perturbs the properties of the DPPC in the other leaflet composed only of DPPC, different properties were studied, such as the atomic density of the different components across the membrane, the electrostatic potential across the membrane, the translational diffusion of DPPC and DPPS, the deuterium order parameters, lipid hydration, and lipid-lipid charge bridges. Thus, we obtained that certain properties such as the surface area lipid molecule, lipid head orientation, order parameter, translational diffusion coefficient, or lipid hydration of DPPC in the leaflet without DPPS remain unperturbed by the presence of DPPS in the other leaflet, compared with a DPPC bilayer. On the other hand, in the leaflet containing DPPS, some of the DPPC properties were strongly affected by the presence of DPPS such as the order parameter or electrostatic potential. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Chemical Society.},

It is therefore important to understand where molecules with anesthetic properties localize within biological membranes. We have determined the free energy profile of a benzocaine molecule (BZC) across a biological membrane using molecular dynamics simulation. We use an asymmetric phospholipid bilayer with DPPS in one leaflet of a DPPC bilayer (L{\'{o}}pez Cascales et al. J. Phys. Chem. B 2006, 110, 2358-2363) to model a biological bilayer. From the free energy profile, we predict the zone of actuation of a benzocaine is located in the hydrocarbon region or at the end of the lipid head, depending of the presence of charged lipids (DPPS) in the leaflet. We observe a moderate increase in the disorder of the membrane and in particular an increase in the disorder of DPPS. Static and dynamic physicochemical properties of the benzocaine, such as its dipole orientation, translational diffusion coefficient, and rotational relaxation time were measured. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Despite the general consensus concerning the role played by sodium channels in the molecular mechanism of local anesthetics, the potency of anaesthetic drugs also seems to be related with their solubility in lipid bilayers. In this respect, this work represents a thermodynamic study of benzocaine insertion into lipid bilayers of different compositions by means of molecular dynamics simulation. Thus, the free energy profiles associated with benzocaine insertion into symmetric lipid bilayers composed of different proportions of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine and dipalmitoylphosphatidylserine were studied. From the simulation results, a maximum in the free energy ($\Delta$G) profile was measured in the region of the lipid/solution interface. This free energy barrier appears to be very much dependent on the lipid composition of the membrane. On the other hand, the minimum free energy ($\Delta$G) within the bilayer remained almost independent of the lipid composition of the bilayer. By repeating the study at different temperatures, it was seen how the spontaneity of benzocaine insertion into the lipid bilayer is due to an increase in the entropy associated with the process. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {The interactions of the neurotransmitter dopamine, and its precursor l-dopa, with membrane lipids were investigated through a set of molecular dynamic simulations with all atom resolution. The results obtained indicate that both dopamine and l-dopa have a pronounced association with the lipid head groups, predominantly mediated through H-bonds. As a result the molecules are anchored to the interfacial region of the membrane. The strength of this interaction is dependent on lipid composition - the presence of phosphatidylserine leads to an increase in the strength of this interaction, resulting in an H-bond network with a lifetime much longer than the timescale of our simulations. Also, bilayers that include sphingomieline and cholesterol interact strongly with dopamine and l-dopa. We postulate that the high membrane association that we have observed for both dopamine and l-dopa could have the following effects: 1) when on the plasma membrane exterior, favour the availability of these compounds for cell membrane uptake processes and, 2) when on an internal membrane surface, accentuate the importance of membrane-bound metabolizing enzymes over their soluble counterparts. Through a computational study, we have shown that both dopamine and l-dopa have a pronounced association with lipid membrane head groups, predominantly mediated through a network of H-bonds. As a result, the molecules are anchored to the interfacial region of the membrane. The strength of this interaction is dependent on lipid composition. Possible effects for the metabolism of dopamine are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors. Journal of Neurochemistry {\textcopyright} 2012 International Society for Neurochemistry.},

abstract = {The contribution of the peripheral and central pharmacokinetic mechanisms of levodopa to the pathogenesis of the motor fluctuations that complicate its long‐term administration was studied in 28 parkinsonian patients. The rate of levodopa clearance from the general circulation, its plasma half‐life, and apparent volume of distribution were indistinguishable between patients with the on‐off or the wearing‐off phenomenon and those with a stable response to levodopa or those who had not been previously treated with levodopa. Peripheral pharmacokinetic factors are thus unlikely to account for the development of these response fluctuations. Conversely, the efficacy half‐time of levodopa differed markedly among the four response groups studied and may provide a quantitative index of central mechanisms that favor the development of the wearing‐off and on‐off phemonena. Although symptom duration was the best predictor of the severity of untreated parkinsonism, levodopa dose correlated best with response half‐time. The wearing‐off phenomenon may primarily reflect the loss of buffering capacity caused by degeneration of the dopamine neurons, while the development of the on‐off phenomenon appears to require additional postsynaptic changes, possibly at the receptor level.

@article{RobertS.Cantor*2003,
abstract = {A mechanism of anesthesia is proposed that addresses one of the most troubling peculiarities of general anesthesia: the remarkably small variability of sensitivity within the human population and across a broad range of animal phyla. It is hypothesized that in addition to the rapid, saturable binding of a neurotransmitter to its receptor that results in activation, the neurotransmitter also acts indirectly on the receptor by diffusing into the postsynaptic membrane and changing its physical properties, causing a shift in receptor conformational equilibrium (desensitization). Unlike binding, this slower indirect mechanism is nonspecific: each neurotransmitter will, in principle, affect all receptors in the membrane. For proteins modeled as having only resting and active conformational states, time-dependent ion currents are predicted that exhibit many characteristics of desensitization for both inhibitory and excitatory channels. If receptors have been engineered to regulate the time course of ion currents by this mechanism, then (a) mutations that significantly alter receptor sensitivity to this effect would be lethal and (b) by design, excitatory receptors would be inhibited, but inhibitory receptors activated, so that their effects are not counterproductive. The wide range of exogenous molecules that affect the physical properties of membranes as do neurotransmitters, but that do not bind to receptors, would thus inhibit excitatory channels and activate inhibitory channels, i.e., they would act as anesthesics. The endogenous anesthetics would thus be the neurotransmitters, the survival advantage conferred by their proper membrane-mediated desensitization of receptors explaining the selection pressure for anesthesic sensitivity.},

Morphology and dimensional distribution of NLCs have been, respectively, characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and photon correlation spectroscopy. The release pattern of BENZO and LIDO from NLCs was evaluated in vitro determining drug percutaneous absorption through excised human skin. Radiant heat tail-flick test was carried out in mice to determine the antinociceptive effect of BENZO and LIDO from NLC. DSC studies revealed that the inner oil phase of NLC plays a significant role in stabilizing the particle architecture and increasing the drug solubility. In vitro evidences show that BENZO and LIDO, when incorporated in viscosized NLC dispersions, exhibited a lower flux with respect to formulations containing the free drugs in the aqueous phase. In vivo study enabled to demonstrate that BENZO and LIDO can be released in a prolonged fashion when incorporated into lipid carriers. The results obtained pointed out NLC capability to act as an effective drug reservoir, thus prolonging the anesthetic effect of BENZO and LIDO. {\textcopyright} 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association.},

The architectures of the complexes were proposed according to 1H NMR data (Job plot, binding constants, and ROESY) indicating details on the insertion of benzocaine in the cavity of the calix[n]arenes. The proposed inclusion compounds were optimized using the PM3 semiempirical method, and the electronic plus nuclear repulsion energy contributions were performed at the DFT level using the PBE exchange/correlation functional and the 6-311G(d) basis set. The remarkable agreement between experimental and theoretical approaches adds support to their use in the structural characterization of the inclusion complexes. In vitro cytotoxic tests showed that complexation intensifies the intrinsic toxicity of benzocaine, possibly by increasing the water solubility of the anesthetic and favoring its partitioning inside of biomembranes.

abstract = {Adequate initial configurations for molecular dynamics simulations consist of arrangements of molecules distributed in space in such a way to approximately represent the system's overall structure. In order that the simulations are not disrupted by large van der Waals repulsive interactions, atoms from different molecules must keep safe pairwise distances. Obtaining such a molecular arrangement can be considered a packing problem: Each type molecule must satisfy spatial constraints related to the geometry of the system, and the distance between atoms of different molecules must be greater than some specified tolerance. We have developed a code able to pack millions of atoms, grouped in arbitrarily complex molecules, inside a variety of three-dimensional regions. The regions may be intersections of spheres, ellipses, cylinders, planes, or boxes. The user must provide only the structure of one molecule of each type and the geometrical constraints that each type of molecule must satisfy. Building complex mixtures, interfaces, solvating biomolecules in water, other solvents, or mixtures of solvents, is straightforward. In addition, different atoms belonging to the same molecule may also be restricted to different spatial regions, in such a way that more ordered molecular arrangements can be built, as micelles, lipid double-layers, etc. The packing time for state-of-the-art molecular dynamics systems varies from a few seconds to a few minutes in a personal computer.

With these parameters the lipid density resulted in perfect agreement with the experimental density.

The average size of the aggregates was estimated using fluorescence quenching experiments, and their dynamics were studied by measuring the 2H-NMR quadrupole splitting ($\Delta$vQ) and the longitudinal relaxation times (T1) of the deuterated species. To provide an atomic insight into these assemblies, molecular dynamics simulations of the systems were carried out with atomic detail. As a previous step in this study, a reparameterization of the standard GROMOS 87 force field was required to perform the equilibrated simulations and to prevent instabilities emerging during the simulations. Finally, an excellent agreement between simulation and experimental data was obtained. In addition, variations in the long range electrostatic interactions at the aggregate/solution interface, the orientation and the re-orientational relaxation time of the water dipole, the translational diffusion coefficient of sodium ions, and the amphiphile-counterion coordination associated with the presence of Li+ in the solution were other key aspects investigated to explain the variation in the quadrupole splittings ($\Delta$vQ) in the presence of lithium in solution. {\textcopyright} 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.},

abstract = {Here, we review the current knowledge about the energetics of arginine insertion into the bilayer hydrocarbon core, and we discuss discrepancies between experimental and computational studies of the insertion process. While simulations suggest that it should be very costly to place arginine into the hydrocarbon core, experiments show that arginine is found there. Both types of studies suggest that arginine insertion into the bilayer involves substantial bilayer deformation, with multiple hydrogen bonds between the arginine guanidinium group and lipid polar groups. It is possible that the discrepancies concerning the insertion cost of arginine arise because simulations overestimate the cost associated with bilayer deformation and underestimate the ability of the bilayer to adapt to charged and polar groups. This is an active area of research, and there is no doubt that a consensus view of arginine in membranes will soon emerge. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.},

abstract = {Successive parameterizations of the GROMOS force field have been used successfully to simulate biomolecular systems over a long period of time. The continuing expansion of computational power with time makes it possible to compute ever more properties for an increasing variety of molecular systems with greater precision. This has led to recurrent parameterizations of the GROMOS force field all aimed at achieving better agreement with experimental data. Here we report the results of the latest, extensive reparameterization of the GROMOS force field. In contrast to the parameterization of other biomolecular force fields, this parameterization of the GROMOS force field is based primarily on reproducing the free enthalpies of hydration and apolar solvation for a range of compounds. This approach was chosen because the relative free enthalpy of solvation between polar and apolar environments is a key property in many biomolecular processes of interest, such as protein folding, biomolecular association, membrane formation, and transport over membranes. The newest parameter sets, 53A5 and 53A6, were optimized by first fitting to reproduce the thermodynamic properties of pure liquids of a range of small polar molecules and the solvation free enthalpies of amino acid analogs in cyclohexane (53A5). The partial charges were then adjusted to reproduce the hydration free enthalpies in water (53A6). Both parameter sets are fully documented, and the differences between these and previous parameter sets are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Furthermore, we find that MNDO ESP charges are superior to AM1 ESP charges in correlating with ESP charges derived from the 6‐31G* basis set. Thus, it is possible to obtain 6‐31G* quality point charges by simply scaling MNDO ESP charges. The charges are scaled in a linear (y = Mx) manner to conserve charge. In this way researchers desiring to carry out force field simulations or minimizations can obtain charges by using MNDO, which requires much less computer time than the corresponding 6‐31G* calculation.

In the present article, an extension of the CHARMM force field to drug-like molecules is presented. The resulting CHARMM General Force Field (CGenFF) covers a wide range of chemical groups present in biomolecules and drug-like molecules, including a large number of heterocyclic scaffolds. The parametrization philosophy behind the force field focuses on quality at the expense of transferability, with the implementation concentrating on an extensible force field. Statistics related to the quality of the parametrization with a focus on experimental validation are presented. Additionally, the parametrization procedure, described fully in the present article in the context of the model systems, pyrrolidine, and 3-phenoxymethylpyrrolidine will allow users to readily extend, the force field to chemical groups that are not explicitly covered in the force field as well as add functional groups to and link together molecules already available in the force field. CGenFF thus makes it possible to perform "allCHARMM" simulations on drug-target interactions thereby extending the utility of CHARMM force fields to medicinally relevant systems. {\textcopyright} 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations of preassembled sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) micelles are carried out using three versions of GROMOS, as well as CHARMM36, OPLS-AA, and OPLS-UA force fields at different aggregation numbers and box sizes. The differences among force fields have little effect on the overall micelle structure of small aggregates of size 60 or 100, but for micelles of an aggregation number of 300 or higher, bicelle structures with ordered tails, rather than the more realistic rodlike or cylindrical micelles with disordered tails, occur when using versions of GROMOS45A3 or the OPLS-AA force fields that are adapted to model the sulfate head group atoms using methods given in the literature. We find that the Lennard-Jones (L-J) parameters for the sodium ions and the ionic oxygens of the SDS head group, as well as the water model, control the transition to bicelles, regardless of other L-J parameters. A closer binding of the sodium ions to the head group ionic oxygens screens the electrostatic repulsions more strongly, resulting in condensation of SDS head groups, leading to unphysical bicelles for GROMOS45A3 or the OPLS-AA force fields, when the aggregation number is large. A telltale sign that the sodium-oxygen interaction is too strong shows up in high nearest neighbor peaks (height {\textgreater}8 and height {\textgreater}20 for micelles with 60 and 100 surfactants, respectively) in the radial distribution functions (RDFs) of sodium ions to ionic oxygens. In the 100-surfactant micelles, the high RDF peak is accompanied by "crystal-like" layering of sodium ions onto the surface of the micelle. The distance between the sodium ions and micelle also depends on the number of waters binding to sodium ions in the presence of surfactant head groups, which depends on both the sodium ion and water models, and for the same sodium model increases as the water model is changed in the order: TIP4P, SPC/E, SPC, and TIP3P. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Chemical Society.},

Each group (n = 6) received four different doses of amethocaine, bupivacaine, lignocaine or procaine, and the duration of the resulting motor block was assessed. Dose-response curves were plotted for each drug. As a measure of activity of the anaesthetics, we used the dose of each drug required to produce block of 60-min duration (D60min) and the correlation between D60min and different drug properties was examined. An inverse linear correlation (r = 0.995; P {\textless} 0.01) was observed between log D60min and the log of the partition coefficient of the local anaesthetics. No correlation was found between the effect and degree of protein binding, pKa or molecular weight.

abstract = {The properties of Na channels of the node of Ranvier are altered by neutral, amine, and quaternary local anesthetic compounds. The kinetics of the Na currents are governed by a composite of voltage- and time-dependent gating processes with voltage- and time-dependent block of channels by drug. Conventional measurements of steady-state sodium inactivation by use of 50-ms prepulses show a large negative voltage shift of the inactivation curve with neutral benzocaine and with some ionizable amines like lidocaine and tetracaine, but no shift is seen with quaternary QX-572. However, when the experiment is done with repetitive application of a prepulse-testpulse waveform, a shift with the quaternary cations (applied internally) is seen as well. 1-min hyperpolarizations of lidocaine- or tetracaine- treated fibers restore two to four times as many channels to the conducting pool as 50-ms hyperpolarizations. Raising the external Ca++ concentration also has a strong unblocking effect. These manipulations do not relieve block in fibers treated with internal quaternary drugs. The results are interpreted in terms of a single receptor in Na channels for the different drug types. Lipid-soluble drug forms are thought to come and go from the receptor via a hydrophobic region of the membrane, while charged and less lipid-soluble forms pass via a hydrophilic region (the inner channel mouth). The hydrophilic pathway is open only when the gates of the channel are open. Any drug form in the channel increases the probability of closing the inactivation gate which, in effect, is equivalent to a negative shift of the voltage dependence of inactivation. {\textcopyright} 1977, Rockefeller University Press., All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A study of a magnetically oriented lyomesophase formed by a quaternary system (Na decyl sulfate/water/decanol/Na sulfate) is reported. Small angle x-ray diffraction measurements have been performed on unoriented samples and samples previously subjected to the action of magnetic fields (H). Diffraction patterns show a diffuse inner halo at 80-140 {\AA} and a sharp outer ring at 38 {\AA}. They reduce to spots in the equator for oriented samples with the x-ray beam parallel to H; no diffraction figure is produced for the x-ray beam perpendicular to H. NMR spectra indicate that the director of the phase orients perpendicular to H. These results show that this lyomesophase has a structure not previously encountered. A model of finite planar micelles surrounded by water is proposed. In this model the micelles consist of a bilayer in the form of platelets, probably disk shaped. These platelets align in presence of magnetic fields, with their plane parallel to H, and further orientational restrictions are imposed by the container; they tend to be parallel and some periodicity appears in the direction of the director of the phase, perpendicular to the plane of polar heads. The mesophase satisfies the definition for nematics taking into account periodicities induced in nematic phases by magnetic fields. {\textcopyright} 1979 American Institute of Physics.},

The ability of 1:5 CHAPSO:DMPC samples to orient is highly tolerant of large changes in temperature, pH, and ionic strength, as well as to the addition of substantial amounts of charged amphiphiles or soluble protein. However, 2H NMR studies of deuterated beta-dodecyl melibiose (DD-MB) solubilized in the system indicate the head group conformation and/or dynamics of this glycolipid analogue is dependent upon the CHAPSO concentration.

	abstract = {Bicelles (bilayered micelles) are model membranes used in the study of peptide structure and membrane interactions. They are traditionally made of long- and short-chain phospholipids, usually dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (D14PC) and dihexanoyl-PC (D6PC). They are attractive membrane mimetics because their composition and planar surface are similar to the native membrane environment. In this work, to improve the solubilization of membrane proteins and allow their study in bicellar systems, D6PC was replaced by detergents from the monoalkylphosphocholine (MAPCHO) family, of which dodecylphosphocholine (12PC) is known for its ability to solubilize membrane proteins. More specifically 12PC, tetradecyl- (14PC), and hexadecyl-PC (16PC) have been employed. To verify the possibility of making bicelles with different hydrophobic thicknesses to better accommodate membrane proteins, D14PC was also replaced by phospholipids with different alkyl chain lengths: dilauroyl-PC (D12PC), dipalmitoyl-PC (D16PC), distearoyl-PC (D18PC), and diarachidoyl-PC (D20PC). Results obtained by 31P solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) at several lipid-to-detergent molar ratios (q) and temperatures indicate that these new MAPCHO bicelles can be formed under a variety of conditions. The quality of their alignment is similar to that of classical bicelles, and the low critical micelle concentration (CMC) of the surfactants and their miscibility with phospholipids are likely to be advantageous for the reconstitution of membrane proteins.},

abstract = {Integral membrane proteins play essential roles in many biological processes, such as energy transduction, transport of molecules, and signaling. The correct function of membrane proteins is likely to depend strongly on the chemical and physical properties of the membrane. However, membrane proteins are not accessible to many biophysical methods in their native cellular membrane. A major limitation for their functional and structural characterization is thus the requirement for an artificial environment that mimics the native membrane to preserve the integrity and stability of the membrane protein. Most commonly employed are detergent micelles, which can however be detrimental to membrane protein activity and stability. Here, we review recent developments for alternative, nonmicellar solubilization techniques, with a particular focus on their application to solution NMR studies. We discuss the use of amphipols and lipid bilayer systems, such as bicelles and nanolipoprotein particles (NLPs). The latter show great promise for structural studies in near native membranes. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The native environment of membrane proteins is complex and scientists have felt the need to simplify it to reduce the number of varying parameters. However, experimental problems can also arise from oversimplification which contributes to why membrane proteins are under-represented in the protein structure databank and why they were difficult to study by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Technological progress now allows dealing with more complex models and, in the context of NMR studies, an incredibly large number of membrane mimetics options are available. This review provides a guide to the selection of the appropriate model membrane system for membrane protein study by NMR, depending on the protein and on the type of information that is looked for. Beside bilayers (of various shapes, sizes and lamellarity), bicelles (aligned or isotropic) and detergent micelles, this review will also describe the most recent membrane mimetics such as amphipols, nanodiscs and reverse micelles. Solution and solid-state NMR will be covered as well as more exotic techniques such as DNP and MAOSS. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Mixtures of long-chain and short-chain phosphatidylcholine (PC) were characterized by multinuclear (13C, 31P, 2H) solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance. This work complements and extends previous characterization of such mixtures by focusing on concentrated mixtures at temperatures above the gel to liquid crystalline phase transition temperature (Tm) of the long-chain PC component. Above Tmit was observed that highly oriented, bilayer-like assemblies could be formed of mixtures of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) and dihexanoylphosphatidylcholine (DHPC) in molar ratios ranging from approximately 1:3.5 to 1:2 (DHPC:DMPC) over a considerable range of lipid concentrations (at least 3-40{\%} w/v total lipid, for a 1:2.5 sample). Orientation was observed to occur only in an L$\alpha$-like phase. The NMR data can be accounted for by a general model of the DHPC-DMPC aggregates in which DHPC can be found in two distinct populations (one highly ordered, one not). The averaged conformations of the glycerol backbone/headgroup regions of the long-and short-chain PC composing the assemblies were judged by solid-state 13C NMR to be similar to each other. The information gleaned about these mixtures and the quality of the oriented NMR spectra obtained suggest that DHPC-DMPC mixtures may prove to be useful as model membrane media in solid-state NMR studies of biomembranes. {\textcopyright} 1992, American Chemical Society.

The dynamics of the interface was examined by measuring deuterium quadrupole splittings from HDO (0.1{\%} D2O in H2O) and 1,1-dideuterodecanol (20{\%} 1,1-dideuterodecanol in DeOH) in 27 samples of each liquid crystal. Aggregation numbers, ND, from 15 samples of each mesophase were obtained using the fluorescence of pyrene quenched by hexadecylpyridinium chloride. ND of TTAB and TTAC are about 230 ± 30 and 300 ± 20, respectively. ND of TTAC increases with increasing concentration of all mesophase components, whereas TTAB shows no correlation between size and composition. The dimension of these aggregates prevents the occurrence of undulations, previously observed in lamellar phases. The quadrupole splitting of decanol-d2 in TTAC is about 5 kHz smaller than in TTAB, and the splitting of HDO is observed only in TTAB. All results are consistent with a more dynamic TTAC interface. The TTAC aggregate should be more dissociated from counterions and the excess ammonium-ammonium electrostatic repulsions contribute to increase the mobility of the interface components. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Efficient and reliable high throughput screen of membrane permeability properties as early as possible in drug discovery and development program is accordingly desirable. Biopartitioning chromatography (BPC) introduces biomembrane-mimetic structures (such as liposome, phospholipid monolayer, micelle, microemulsion, vesicle and bicelle, etc) into chromatographic system, i.e. liquid system or capillary electrophoresis, and thereby emulates drug-membrane interactions difficult to study in the liquid state by well reproducible, rapid, sensitive and adequately designed chromatographic technique. And recently BPC has been becoming a high-throughput screening platform for drug membrane permeability and biological activity. The theoretical basis, classification and application of BPC were summarized based on the latest advances and our recent works.

	abstract = {An ionophore antibiotic salinomycin was studied in a membrane environment consisting of isotropic bicelles, a better model for biological membranes than micelles, and its conformation and topological orientation in bicelles was determined. 2D NMR measurements and restrained conformational search revealed that salinomycin-sodium salt in bicelles adopts an open conformation in which the orientation of the E-ring is significantly different from that in crystal and solution structures. This conformational alteration breaks an intramolecular hydrogen bond between 28-OH and 1-O, dislocates the ether oxygen of the E-ring from a coordinated position to the sodium ion observed in the crystal, and consequently weakens the complexation between salinomycin and the sodium ion. Paramagnetic relaxation experiments using doxylphospholipids reveal that salinomycin is embedded shallowly in bicelles, with both terminals being closer to the water interface and the olefin portion facing the bicelle interior. Measurements of intermolecular NOEs between salinomycin and phospholipids further supported this orientation. Weaker complexation with sodium ion and positional preference in the membrane polar region may facilitate the catch-and-release of metal ions at the polar/nonpolar interface of bilayers. On the basis of these findings, a model for salinomycin-assisted transport of metal ions across biological membranes is proposed. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Chemical Society.},

Transient association of ethanol with magnetically aligned bicelles imparts a small degree of anisotropy to the solute. This anisotropy allows detection of residual 1H- 1H and 1H- 13C dipolar couplings, which are superimposed on scalar couplings. Residual 2H NMR quadrupole splittings of isotope-labeled ethanol were measured as well. The analysis of residual tensorial interactions yielded information on the orientation and motions of ethanol in the membrane-bound state. The fraction of phosphatidylcholine-bound ethanol was determined independently by gas chromatography and NMR. About 4{\%} of ethanol is bound to phosphatidylcholine at a bicelle concentration of 14 wt {\%} at 40°C. Free and bound ethanol are in rapid exchange. The lifetime of ethanol association with phosphatidylcholine membranes is of the order of a few nanoseconds. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations were used to examine the partitioning behaviour of the local anaesthetic benzocaine and the anti-epileptic phenytoin into lipid bilayers, a factor that is critical to their mode of action. Free energy methods are used to quantify the thermodynamics of drug movement between water and octanol as well as for permeation across a POPC membrane. Both drugs are shown to favourably partition into the lipid bilayer from water and are likely to accumulate just inside the lipid headgroups where they may alter bilayer properties or interact with target proteins. Phenytoin experiences a large barrier to cross the centre of the bilayer due to less favourable energetic interactions in this less dense region of the bilayer. Remarkably, in our simulations both drugs are able to pull water into the bilayer, creating water chains that extend back to bulk, and which may modify the local bilayer properties. We find that the choice of atomic partial charges can have a significant impact on the quantitative results, meaning that careful validation of parameters for new drugs, such as performed here, should be performed prior to their use in biomolecular simulations. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Comparisons are made with experimental thermodynamic and structural data including the recent neutron diffraction results of Thiessen and Narten. The computed densities and potential energies are in reasonable accord with experiment except for the original BF model, which yields an 18{\%} overestimate of the density and poor structural results. The TIPS2 and TIP4P potentials yield oxygen-oxygen partial structure functions in good agreement with the neutron diffraction results. The accord with the experimental OH and HH partial structure functions is poorer; however, the computed results for these functions are similar for all the potential functions. Consequently, the discrepancy may be due to the correction terms needed in processing the neutron data or to an effect uniformly neglected in the computations. Comparisons are also made for self-diffusion coefficients obtained from molecular dynamics simulations. Overall, the SPC, ST2, TIPS2, and TIP4P models give reasonable structural and thermodynamic descriptions of liquid water and they should be useful in simulations of aqueous solutions. The simplicity of the SPC, TIPS2, and TIP4P functions is also attractive from a computational standpoint. {\textcopyright} 1983 American Institute of Physics.},

The method relies on knowledge of the minimum energy path and bases the activation free energy calculation on moving along this path from a minimum to a saddle point. Use is made of a local reaction coordinate which describes the advance of the reaction in each segment of the minimum energy path. The activation free energy is formulated as a sum of two terms. The first is due to the change in the local reaction coordinate between the endpoints of each segment of the path. The second is due to the change in direction of the minimum energy path between consecutive segments. Both contributions can be obtained by molecular dynamics simulations with a constraint on the local reaction coordinate. The method is illustrated by applying it to a model potential and to the C7eq to C7ax transition in the alanine dipeptide. It is found that the term due to the change of direction in the reaction path can make a substantial contribution to the activation free energy. {\textcopyright} 1996 American Institute of Physics.},
